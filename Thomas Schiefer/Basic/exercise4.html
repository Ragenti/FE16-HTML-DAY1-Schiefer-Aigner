            From Troy Duffy, writer and director of The Boondock Saints, comes the much anticipated sequel to 
            the tough, stylized cutting edge saga of the MacManus brothers (Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick 
            Flanery). The two have been in deep hiding with their father, Il Duce (Billy Connolly), in the quiet 
            valleys of Ireland, far removed from their former vigilante lives. When word comes that a beloved 
            priest has been killed by sinister forces from deep within the mob, the brothers return to Boston to 
            mount a violent and bloody crusade to bring justice to those responsible. With a new partner in 
            crime (Clifton Collins Jr., Star Trek) and a sexy FBI operative (Julie Benz, TV's “Dexter”) hot on their 
            trail…the Saints are back!
