        <span>Oh, ho, ho, it's magic</span>, you know

    <div>
        Never been awake
        Never seen a day break
        Leaning on my pillow in the morning
        Lazy day in bed
        Music in my head
        Crazy music playing in the <span>morning light</span>

        I love a sunny day
        Dream of far away
        Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
        Never been awake
        Never seen a day break
        Leaning on my pillow in the <span>morning light</span>
