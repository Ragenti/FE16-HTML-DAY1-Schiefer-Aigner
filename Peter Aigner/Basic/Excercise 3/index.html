      <div style="border: 1px solid black">
        Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? <br />
        Caught in a landside, No escape from reality <br />
        Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see,

    </p>
    <p><div>
      I'm just a poor boy, <br />
      I need no sympathy,<br /></div>
      Because I'm easy come, easy go, <br />
      Little high, little low, 
    </p>
    <p>Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to Me,</p>
    <p>to me</p>
    <p>
      Mamaaa, Just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
      Now he's dead Mamaaa, life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it
      all away Mama, oooh, Didn't mean to make you cry, If I'm not back again
      this time tomorrow, Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late, my time has come, Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
      The time Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go, Gotta leave you all behind
      and face the truth Mama, oooh I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd
      never been born at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do
      the Fandango!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me Galileo, Galileo
      Galileo, Galileo Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo

    <p>
      I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor
      family, Spare him his life from this monstrosity Easy come, easy go, will
      you let me go Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!)
      Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let
      you go (Let me go) Will not let you go (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
      (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah No, no, no, no, no, no, no
      Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go Beelzebub has a devil put aside
      for me, for me, For meee
    </p>
    <p>
      So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye So you think you can love
      me and leave me to die Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby, Just gotta get
      out, just gotta get right outta here
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing really matters, Anyone can see, Nothing really matters, Nothing
      really matters to me Any way the wind blows...
